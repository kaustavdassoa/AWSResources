01 â€” ABOUT THE COURSE
Hello Cloud Gurus!

The AWS Certified Solutions Architect Professional (CSA-Pro) exam reaches far beyond testing in-depth knowledge of the AWS platform and delves into your ability to make decisions in ambiguous situations, wrestle with sub-optimal trade-offs, and tease-out minute details from paragraphs of text. All this is carefully designed to permit only those with true, multi-dimensional mastery of cloud architectures to call themselves Certified Solutions Architects at the Professional level.


The CSA-Pro exam is for advanced practitioners, and so is this course. We assume that you already have several years of AWS architecture experience behind you and that you already hold the AWS CSA-A certification, if not all three Associate-level AWS certs. This course will not only help you slay the CSA-Pro dragon with confidence, but will also help you continue to develop professionally as a Solutions Architect.
